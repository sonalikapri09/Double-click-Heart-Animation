# Double-click-Heart-Animation

Double-Click Heart Animation (Inspired by Instagram)
This project recreates the double-click heart animation similar to Instagram's "like" feature. When you double-click on the image, a heart icon smoothly appears and then fades away, creating an effect.

Features:

Double-click action: The heart icon shows up when you double-click the image.
Smooth animation: The heart scales up and fades out smoothly using CSS transitions.
Responsive design: The container and image adjust to different screen sizes.

Technologies Used:

HTML
CSS (for layout and animations)
JavaScript (for handling events)
